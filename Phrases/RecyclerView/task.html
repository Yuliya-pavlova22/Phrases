<h5 id="description">Description </h5>
<p>To see the phrases that you have added to the application, you need to print them somewhere on the screen. In this stage, you need to set up the <code class="java">RecyclerView</code> so that it shows the list of the phrases on your activity screen.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Create an XML layout for your <code class="java">RecyclerView</code> items. The view should contain a <code class="java">TextView</code> with the phrase <em>(</em>ID:<em> </em><code class="java">phraseTextView</code><em>)</em> and a <code class="java">Delete</code> <code class="java">TextView</code> to remove it <em>(</em>ID:<em> </em><code class="java">deleteTextView</code><em>)</em>. You are free to design the app however you want, but don't change the IDs of the two <code class="java">Views</code>;</li>
<li>Create an adapter for your <code class="java">RecyclerView</code>. The adapter should show the list with your predefined phrases. Set an <code class="java">OnClickListener</code> for the <code class="java">Delete</code> <code class="java">TextView</code> that will remove the item. In this stage, we don't need you to save user's actions in any way, so it's okay if you restart the app, but the deleted phrases are back;</li>
<li>Show at least three phrases on the screen.</li>
</ol>
